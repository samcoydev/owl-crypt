# Owl Crypt

Owl Crypt is a terminal / text based dungeon crawler game. It is designed to be
highly configurable and moddable. The game is designed to be played on a server
(preferably a Raspberry Pi) and played by up to 4 players.

This is still in development and is not yet playable, however a lot of the foundation
is in place as of 06/11/2024.

Programmers will be able to mod the game and create dungeons using Python, and the
library provided in these source files. The flexibility will allow for a wide range
of mechanics and story telling. For instance, by flipping the raspberry pi upside
down, the dungeon could flip. Or by shining a light on a light sensor, the dungeon
could have some kind of light puzzle. The goal is to make the possibilities as close
to endless as possible.
